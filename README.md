# Tasks for the DevPool Directory

This repository hosts tasks for the [devpool-directory repository](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory), herein referred to as the "Directory." The Directory aggregates all of the open tasks from the DevPool [partner network](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory/blob/development/projects.json). We can not store the tasks on the Directory itself because:
- We don't want to mix partners' tasks with Directory specific tasks.
- We disable github notifications for the Directory because it produces too many notifications.
